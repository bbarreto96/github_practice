This is another commit! 

and here we got with many other commits! 

okay so lets clear some things up...

whats the conclusion here? 
Basically, i have two options to incldue all of my changes (new files, editted files etc etc) and that is to is commands like 

git add <specific file name> 
or 
git add . 
---> which is way more convinient ....

once we have added these to the staging stage...

we are now allowed to COMMIT them or take a SNAPSHOT of the new edits/code and upload them to github etc etc... or just keep on the terminal itself for future use...

lets try that out once again
